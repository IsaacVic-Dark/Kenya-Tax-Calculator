A simple, user-friendly web application that helps individuals in Kenya calculate their monthly or annual income tax based on the **progressive tax system** defined by the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA).

## ðŸ“š About the Project

This web app takes the userâ€™s gross income as input and calculates their applicable income tax using Kenya's PAYE (Pay As You Earn) tax bands. The results include:

## ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡ª Understanding Kenya's Progressive Tax System

Kenya uses a **progressive tax system**, meaning the more you earn, the higher the percentage of tax you pay â€” but only on the income within each bracket. As of recent updates from KRA, the tax bands are as follows:

| Income Band (Monthly)       | Tax Rate  |
|----------------------------|-----------|
| KSh 0 â€“ 24,000             | 10%       |
| KSh 24,001 â€“ 32,333        | 25%       |
| KSh 32,334 and above       | 30%       |

> **Important**: Only the portion of income that falls within a given band is taxed at that rate. For example, if you earn KSh 35,000 per month:
> - The first 24,000 is taxed at 10%
> - The next 8,333 (from 24,001 to 32,333) is taxed at 25%
> - The remaining 2,667 is taxed at 30%

Additionally, personal relief (currently KSh 2,400/month) is deducted from the final tax amount to reduce the total payable.
